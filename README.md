*Stock Simulator*
================================

An extension to my biased random walk simulator that now uses the Black Scholes Option pricing model on a stock that is modelled as a standard stationary time series process.

Info
================================
Python scripts are found here as well as a 'Results' folder to see screenshots of the compiled plots.
Feel free to look around and fork the repository if you have any suggestions.
